## 📌 About
Welcome to **Datascience_tips**! This repository serves as a central hub for sharing and organizing tips on the effective usage of **statistics** and **data science** methodologies. It is more beginners oriented as I am still learning, you'll find useful insights, best practices, and practical applications to enhance your workflow.

## 📖 What You'll Find Here
Right now I only added a normality test document but I plan to do the following
- 🏗 **Fundamentals of Statistics** (Descriptive stats, Probability, Normality tests, Hypothesis testing)
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Visualization techniques, Feature engineering, Outlier detection)
- 🏎 **Machine Learning Best Practices** (Model selection, Cross-validation, Performances measurement)
- 🧠 **Advanced Topics** (Time series analysis, Deep learning insights)
- 📜 **Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them** (Overfitting, Misinterpreting p-values)
